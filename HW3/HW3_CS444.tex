When & What & Duration \\ \hline
10/18/2016 
& We met at Kelly Computer Lab to discuss about the content of the assignments and the requirements to be done. We decided to implement "Pair Programming" again since both of us weren't familiar with the elevator concept at that time. We spent two hours to understand the different type of schedulers. 
& 2 hours\\ 
\hline

10/20/2016 
& We had a better understanding about the homework after we listened to some questions asked by classmates. Thus, after the class, we met a Kelly to create an algorithm for SSTF in a piece of paper. Furthermore, we also had to do some research about the noop-iosched code because it wasn't easy to read and understand every structs, pointers and variables in that code.  
& 3 hours\\ 
\hline

10/21/2016 
& We started to test our SSTF algorithm by modifying the copy of noop-iosched.c code. First, we changed every function name that has the word noop into sstf. Next, we modified the noop struct because sstf is going to need more variables.  In our design concept, we thought that the only function that needed major modification was the sstf\_dispatch. Thus we spent a lot of time trying to convert our algorithm into code carefully. We used the rest of our time to fix compile errors and do research to disable vitio.
& 5 hours\\ 
\hline

10/22/2016 
& We encountered a difficulty in enabling our scheduler into the virtual machine. We either got a kernel panic or received an error message when switching the scheduler.
Since this is not a common problem, we were having a difficulty finding helpful information from the internet. Thus, we had to spend most of our time only to fix this issue. Being able to switch the scheduler is important to us because we wanted to know whether our SSTF code works or not. 
& 5 hours\\ 
\hline

10/23/2016 
& We tried to fix the virtual machine issue and make a modification to any logic error in our SSTF code. After several hours of doing it, we felt that the current code has met the assignment requirements. Thus, we continued by creating a patch file and writing the LaTex documentation.
& 5 hours\\
